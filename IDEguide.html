<!-- region Mouse operations-->
 <h1 id="Mouse">Mouse operation &#8211; quick reference</h1>
 <li>To select a frame, click on the keyword at the start the frame. (You can successfully click in several other places within the frame, but the simplest rule to remember is click on the starting keyword).</li>
 <li>To select an additional frame (&#8216;multi-select&#8217;), hold down the Shift key on the keyboard and click on the frame to add to the current selection. Note that all the multi-selected frames must be at peer-level (the same level of indentation) and, unless global frames, must be within the same &#8216;parent&#8217; frame.</li>
 <li>To select a field, click on the text (or, if empty, the prompt) shown for that field. Having selected the field, you may then click again at a particular place within the text to position the text cursor. (By default, when a field is selected the text cursor will be at the right-hand end of any existing text).</li>
 <li>To collapse a multi-line frame, double-click on the keyword at the start of the frame</li>
 <li>To expand a collapsed frame, double-click on the keyword at the start of the frame (or the &#8216;+&#8217; symbol in front of it).</li>
 
 <p>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</p>
 <li>To move selected frame, or frames, up or down within the same peer level hold down the Ctrl key and drag the mouse, or move the scroll wheel</li>
 <li>Scrolling of options within the &#8216;autocomplete&#8217; popup using the mouse wheel.</li>
