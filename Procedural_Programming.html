<h2 id="Defining_named_values">Defining named values</h2>
<p>There are several kinds of name value in Elan, defined by:</p>
<li>A <el-code>constant</el-code> (which might be a user-defined <el-code>constant</el-code> or a library <el-code>constant</el-code>)</li>
<li>A <el-code>let</el-code> statement (see below)</li>
<li>A <el-code>variable</el-code> statement</li>
<li>A parameter in a <el-code>function</el-code> or a <el-code>procedure</el-code>: see <span class="Link">Functions and procedures</span></li>


<h3>Variable statement</h3>
<p>The <el-code>variable </el-code>statement is used to define, and initialise, a new variable. Unlike a named value defined by a let statement, a variable may be re-assigned from its initial value to a new value.</p>
<p>The name given to the variable must follow the rules for an <a href="#Identifier">Identifier</a>.</p>
<p>The value to which the new variable is initialised may be a literal value, or a more complex expression. Either way, the resulting value defines the Type for that variable.</p>

<h3>Set statement</h3>
<p>The <el-code>set</el-code> statement is used to assign a new value to an existing variable. The new value must be of the same Type (or a Type compatible with) that of the variable.</p>
<p>A set statement may not assign a new value to a parameter: see <a href="#Parameter_passing_1">Parameter passing</a>.</p>


<h3 id="Parameter_passing_1">Parameter passing</h3>
<p>The arguments provided to a method (function or procedure) are passed &#8216;by value&#8217; and not &#8216;by reference&#8217;. If you wish to be able to re-assign the value associated with a parameter, such that that change would be visible to the code that calls the procedure, then you can precede the parameter definition with the keyword <el-code>out</el-code>. This is useful when you are passing in, say, an <el-code>Int</el-code> that refers to an index, and you want the procedure to update the index number it is pointing to.</p>
<p> Note, however, that mutating an instance of a reference Type held in a variable is not the same thing as re-assigning the variable to a different instance. The first changes the contents of the thing, the second changes the thing for another thing!</p>
<p>Therefore, if</p>
<li>the method is a <el-code>procedure</el-code> AND</li>
<li>the Type of the argument is a &#8216;reference Type&#8217; AND</li>
<li>that Type is mutable such as an <el-code>Array</el-code>, <el-code>Dictionary</el-code>, <el-code>Stack</el-code>, <el-code>Queue</el-code>, or a user-defined <el-code>class</el-code></li>
<p>then it is possible to mutate the parameter that holds that argument within the procedure, such that any reference to the argument outside the procedure will &#8216;see&#8217; the changes. </p>
<p>A good example of this is an &#8216;in-place sort&#8217; procedure. In the following code the <el-code>arr</el-code> parameter is mutated in the two highlighted lines:</p>
<el-code>procedure inPlaceRippleSort(arr as Array&lt;of Int&gt;)</el-code><br>
<el-code>  variable changes set to true</el-code><br>
<el-code>  variable lastComp set to arr.length() - 2</el-code><br>
<el-code>  repeat</el-code><br>
<el-code>    set changes to false</el-code><br>
<el-code>    for i from 0 to lastComp step 1</el-code><br>
<el-code>      if arr [i] &gt; arr [i + 1] then</el-code><br>
<el-code>        variable temp set to arr [i]</el-code><br>
<el-code>        set arr[i] to arr[i + 1]</el-code><br>
<el-code>        set arr[i + 1] to temp</el-code><br>
<el-code>        set changes to true</el-code><br>
<el-code>      end if</el-code><br>
<el-code>    end for</el-code><br>
<el-code>    set lastComp to lastComp - 1</el-code><br>
<el-code>  end repeat when not changes</el-code><br>
<el-code>end procedure</el-code><br>

<p>Note however that:</p>
<li>In a <el-code>function</el-code> you may not mutate any parameter</li>
<li>In a <el-code>procedure</el-code> you may not re-assign any parameter</li>




<h2>Generating random numbers</h2>
<p>Random numbers may be created by calling one of these two standard methods:</p>
<li><el-code>random() returns</el-code>s a <el-code>Float</el-code> in the range 0 &#8230; 1</li>
<li><el-code>randomInt(min, max) returns</el-code>s an <el-code>Int</el-code> in the range <el-code>min</el-code> to <el-code>max</el-code> inclusive</li>
<p>For example:</p>
<el-code><br>
let probability be random()<br>
print probability</p>
for i from 1 to 10 step 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print randomInt(1, 6)<br>
end for
</el-code><br>
<p>Notes</p>
<li>These two methods are both <a href="#System_methods">System methods</a>, so they may be used only within <el-code>main</el-code> or a <el-code>procedure</el-code>.  A resulting <span class="Hyperlink"><a href="#System_methods">Int</a></span> or <el-code>Float</el-code> may then be used as an argument to pass into a <el-code>function</el-code>.</li>
<li>Elan provides a separate mechanism for generating random numbers within a <el-code>function</el-code>: See <a href="#Generating_random_numbers">Generating random numbers within a function</a>.</li>
